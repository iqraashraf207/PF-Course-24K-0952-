The approach to this problem was to create an array to store all the values then check the array to find the second smallest number by taking the first element as second smallest and then applying if conditions to check whether there were any smallest and second smallest numbers and storing them in their respective variables by replacing the previously stored values.

I learned how to iterate through an array using a for loop.
I also learned how to find the second smallest number, earlier only knew how to find the smallest.
