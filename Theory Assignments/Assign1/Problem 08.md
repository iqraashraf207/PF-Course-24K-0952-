**Pseudocode**
1.	Start
2.	Input num
3.	Let sum=0
4.	While (num>0) do
5.	Let digit=num%10
6.	Sum= sum + digit
7.	Num= num //10
8.	Endwhile
9.	Print the sum is, sum
10.	End

The problem requires designing a program for calculating the sum of digits of a number. First we find the digits by taking number % 10. Then we calculate sum=sum + digit (we initially set sum to zero). Afterwards we remove the last digit by taking number // 10. This process is repeated until number equals zero. The sum of the digits of the number is calculated with this procedure.
