**Pseudocode**
1.	Start
2.	Input money, onionprice, apricotprice, grapeprice, tomatoprice, qtyonion, qtyapricot, qtygrape, qtytomato
3.	Let cost= (onionprice * qtyonion) + (apricotprice * qtyapricot) + (grapeprice * qtygrape) + (tomatoprice * qtytomato)
4.	Print cost
5.	If (money>=cost), then 
6.	Let change=money-cost
7.	Print change
8.	Else print not enough money
9.	End

The problem indicates designing a solution to help Mr. Bhoola figure out how much he needs to pay and how much change he gets back. First we will ask Mr. Bhoola for money he has, then calculate price by multiplying the items with their costs. Afterwards, we will calculate change (money-cost) to return to Mr. Bhoola.
