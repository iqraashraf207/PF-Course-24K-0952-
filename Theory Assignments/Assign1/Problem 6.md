**Pseudocode**
1.	Start
2.	Input height, age, ride
3.	If (ride==dragon roller coaster), then check
4.	If (height>=48 && age>=10), then print you meet the criteria for dragon roller coaster
5.	Else print you don’t meet the criteria
6.	Else if (ride==sky swing), then check
7.	If (height>=54), then print you meet the criteria for sky swing
8.	Else print you don’t meet the criteria
9.	Else if (ride==carousel), then check
10.	If (age>=5), then print you meet the criteria for carousel
11.	Else print you don’t meet the criteria
12.	End if
13.	End

The problem requires designing a program to determine the eligibilty for a ride. If the ride is dragon roller coaster, then height must be 48 inches or above and age must be 10 years or above for riding it. If the ride is sky swing, then height must be 54 inches or above for riding it. If the ride is carousel, then age must be 5 years or above for riding it. Otherwise the person does not meet the criteria for the rides.
