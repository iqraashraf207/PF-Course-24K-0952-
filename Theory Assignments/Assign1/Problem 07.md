**Pseudocode**
1.	Start
2.	Input lcdpanel
3.	If lcdpanel==1111110, then
4.	Let floor=0
5.	Print the lift is on, floor
6.	Else if lcdpanel==0110000, then
7.	Let floor=1
8.	Print the lift is on, floor
9.	Else if lcdpanel==1101101, then
10.	Let floor=2
11.	Print the lift is on, floor
12.	Else if lcdpanel==1111001, then
13.	Let floor=3
14.	Print the lift is on, floor
15.	Else if lcdpanel==0110011, then
16.	Let floor=4
17.	Print the lift is on, floor
18.	Else if lcdpanel==1011011, then
19.	Let floor=5
20.	Print the lift is on, floor
21.	Else if lcdpanel==1011111, then
22.	Let floor=6
23.	Print the lift is on, floor
24.	Else if lcdpanel==1110000, then
25.	Let floor=7
26.	Print the lift is on, floor
27.	Else if lcdpanel==1111111, then
28.	Let floor=8
29.	Print the lift is on, floor
30.	Else if lcdpanel==1111011, then
31.	Let floor=9
32.	Print the lift is on, floor
33.	Else print error
34.	End

In this problem, we have to determine the floor on which lift is on. There is a certain lcdpanel for every floor. If the condition of the lcdpanel is met, then the lift is on that respective floor.
