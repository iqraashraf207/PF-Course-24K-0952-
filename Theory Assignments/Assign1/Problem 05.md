**Pseudocode**
1.	Start
2.	Input crop, soilmoisture, rainin24hrs
3.	If (crop==wheat), then check
4.	If (soilmoisture < 30 || rainin24hrs==0), then print initiate irrigation for wheat
5.	Else print no irrigation
6.	Else if (crop==corn), then check
7.	If (soilmoisture < 40), then print initiate irrigation for corn
8.	Else print no irrigation
9.	Else if (crop==rice), then check
10.	If (soilmoisture < 25 || rainin24hrs==0), then print initiate irrigation for rice
11.	Else print no irrigation
12.	Else print no irrigation is applied
13.	End

The problem involves designing a solution to determine if irrigation will be done or not. If the crop is wheat, then soilmoisture has to be less than 30 percent and no rain in 24 hours to start irrigation. If the crop is corn, then soilmoisture has to be less than 40 percent to start irrigation. If the crop is rice, then soilmoisture has to be less than 25 percent and no rain in 24 hours to start irrigation. If soilmoisture is above these thresholds, then no irrigation takes place.
