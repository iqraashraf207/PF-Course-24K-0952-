**Pseudocode**
1.	Start
2.	Input province, gender, age
3.	If (province==Sindh), then check
4.	if (age>=18), then print legal to marry
5.	else print not legal
6.	Else if (province==Punjab), then check
7.	if (gender==male), then check
8.	if (age>=18), print legal to marry
9.	else print not legal
10.	else if (age>=16), then print legal to marry
11.	else print not legal
12.	Else print invalid input
13.	End

The problem requires designing a program that checks whether a person can legally marry in Pakistan based on the marriage laws of either Punjab or Sindh. In Sindh, if the individual (male or female) is 18 or above, then they can legally marry. In Punjab, if a male is above 18, he is legally allowed to marry and if a female is 16 or above, she can legally marry. If these conditions are not met, it is not legal to marry.
