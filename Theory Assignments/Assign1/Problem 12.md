**Pseudocode**
1.	Start
2.	Input jug3, jug5
3.	Let jug5=5
4.	Jug3=3
5.	Jug5=jug5-jug3
6.	Let Jug3=0
7.	Jug3=jug5
8.	Let jug5=0
9.	Jug5=5
10.	Let space=3-jug3
11.	Jug5=jug5-space
12.	Jug3=jug3+space
13.	Print the liters are, jug5
14.	End 

In this problem, we need to fill one of the jugs with 4 liters to defuse a bomb. We can fill the five liter jug with 4 liters. To do this first we will fill the five liter completely then transfer the water to three liter jug. This leaves us with only 2 liters left in five liter jug. We will transfer these 2 liters to the three liter jug first emptying it and then pouring. We will then again fill the five liter jug again, pour it in the three liter jug already containing 2 liters of water. So only 1 liter will be poured from the five liter jug to the three liter one leaving us with exactly 4 liters in the five liter jug.
