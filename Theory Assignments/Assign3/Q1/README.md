![Q1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce5f9403-b63f-48d0-ac64-5f1ee254ffc9)

The approach to this problem was to use functions for different purposes. Firstly, user input function to get employee information, then another function to calculate the employee tenure, and lastly call the functions in the main.

I learned using structures for different things. I also learned to create multiple functions in this program.
